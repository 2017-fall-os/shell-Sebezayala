## Simple Unix Shell

This version of the shell wast tested using the testShell.sh script provided and passed most of the tests. However it still has a lot of bugs and errors that need to be fixed.

This version of the shell for some reason passed the redirect test even when it is not an implemented feature. It also failed the background test, however it works if used manually.

## To Compile
Simply run make from the shell folder by typing make in the terminal.
You can delete the files created by make, by typing make clean in the termianl.

## To Use 
After compiling run myShell from the shell folder by typing ./myShell in the terminal.
You will be prompted by a $ sign here you can start typing commands.
You can exit the shell with the word "exit"
